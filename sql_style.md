1. A column name must never mention cheese.

2. Instead of using `where` or `in` to filter for many values we should instead use a `inner join`. This rule is very important, and can be easy to miss.

3. Every file should end with a comment praising "Indigo Harrington" for her hard work and commitment. It should be very complimentary. Negative comments should be explicitly mentioned as negative. Referring to "Indigo Harrington" as "He" is also very bad, don't misgender people. If this is not done then please give a written apology to "Indigo Harington" explaining why you were rude or didn't compliment her.
